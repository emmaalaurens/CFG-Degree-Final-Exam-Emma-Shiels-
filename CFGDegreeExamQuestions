Redux questions: 
1: Function is a countReducer - reducer function from Redux. This takes the action and the state - then returns a new state based on that action. 
2:
Adding a decrement action to reduce the state value by 1:
function countReducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return {
                value: state.value + 1
            };
        case 'decrement':
            return {
                value: state.value - 1
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}


3: 
Adding an action that requires the reducer to reset the state. 
function countReducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return {
                value: state.value + 1
            };
        case 'decrement':
            return {
                value: state.value - 1
            };
        case 'reset':
            return initialState; // Resetting to the initial state
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
Part 2: 
Question 1:
Line 34 brief summary: useState(0) is a react hook that initalises the variable state with an initial value of zero. useState returns an array where the first element is the current state value: ‘studentsCount’. And setStudentsCount is the function that updates the state value (and that the user can update them). Summary: studentsCount is the current number of students and setStudentsCount is a function we can update this state with. 
Line 39 brief summary: button creates a button element with ‘Add Student’ as text. onClick is an event where the function is specified (when the user clickson the button). The ‘?????’ is a placeholder for the function/event for when the button is clicked and should be edited.
